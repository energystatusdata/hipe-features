## Reproducing the feature data

Steps to generate the feature data from raw measurements:

1. Install `python3.6`, `python3.6-dev` and `pipenv`.
2. Run `pipenv install` to fetch all python dependencies.
3. Run `pipenv run feature-extraction` to calculate the features. The script automatically downloads the [HIPE](https://www.energystatusdata.kit.edu/hipe.php) data set and runs the feature extraction. The final feature data sets are then in `data/`.
